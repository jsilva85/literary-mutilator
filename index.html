Let's have a nice tree right here. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. We have a fantastic little sky! We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.

Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. It's cold, but it's beautiful. You are only limited by your imagination. Every day I learn.

Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.
